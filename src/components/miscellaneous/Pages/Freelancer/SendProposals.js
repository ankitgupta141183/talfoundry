                <p>You can send a Quote to a job either from the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.Talfoundry.com/d/jobs/" target="_blank">Find Jobs</a> page or from the Job Details page by clicking on “Send a Quote” button.</p>
                <p>Sending a Quote is a quick, three-step
                process:</p>

                <p><strong>1. Set
                Payment Terms:</strong></p>

                <ul><li><strong>Choose a Suitable Payment Term:</strong> Depending on the nature of the job and your working style, you can choose from four <a href="https://www.Talfoundry.com/help/employer/payment-terms-freelancer/">Payment terms</a>. You can also choose to skip setting a payment term at this stage. A Placeholder Bid will be sent to the Employer and the Payment term can be finalized later.</li><li><strong>Set SafePay Balance: </strong>This is the minimum balance you require in the SafePay before beginning work.</li><li><strong>Set Automatic Payments (AutoPay):</strong> You can set the number of days within which invoices must be paid by the Employer. The funds are automatically released from SafePay and credited to your <a href="https://www.Talfoundry.com/help/freelancer/cash-account-freelancer/">Cash Account</a>.</li><li><strong>Split Job Fee:</strong> You can choose to split up to 5% of the <a href="https://www.Talfoundry.com/help/freelancer/job-fee/">job fee</a> with the Employer.</li><li><strong>Work Updates: </strong>You can set how frequently you’d like to share work updates.</li></ul>

                <p><strong>2. Define
                Scope of Work: </strong>Define your understanding of the job,
                how you want to approach it and the timeframe along with deliverables.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Finalize
                Quote: </strong>Before sending the Quote:</p>

                <ul><li>Send a Premium Quote to stand out amongst other Quotes received by the Employer.</li><li>You can choose to <strong>share your contact info.</strong> Employers will be able to see your email and phone number along with your Quote.</li><li>Make the <strong>transaction private</strong>, if required. For private transactions, earnings and transaction data is not added to your Profile and All-Time Transaction Data. Know more about it <a href="https://www.Talfoundry.com/help/freelancer/private-transactions/">here</a>.</li><li><strong>Enable Auto-accept</strong> and set a date before which you will get hired automatically if the Employer accepts your Quote. This helps in creating a WorkRoom immediately and getting work started.</li></ul>
                <h4>Note:</h4>

                <ul><li>When a Quote is sent to an Employer, we display the <a href="https://www.Talfoundry.com/help/freelancer/all-time-transaction-data-freelancer/">All-Time Transaction Data</a> of the Freelancer along with the Quote. However, if there is no transaction history on Talfoundry, we display Freelancers’ <a href="https://www.Talfoundry.com/help/freelancer/about-id-verification-freelancer/">ID Verification</a><strong> </strong>status with the Quote.</li></ul>
