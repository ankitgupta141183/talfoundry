                <p>Security Questions help protect your account from unauthorized access and prevent fraud. This extra layer of security protects your account at login stage and makes it difficult for anyone who isnâ€™t you to gain access to your account.</p>

                <p>We may prompt you with security questions at different stages while you are working on Talfoundry. Security questions are generally prompted when you try to access specific parts of your account or when our security systems detect a login attempt or any other operation that appears to be high-risk. To help protect your account, we recommend setting up security questions at the earliest.</p>
