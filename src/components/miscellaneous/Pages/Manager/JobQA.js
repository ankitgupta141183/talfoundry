                    <p>Every job posted on Talfoundry has a public
                    Q&amp;A board where Freelancers can seek clarification regarding the job
                    directly from the Employer. All Freelancers on Talfoundry can view the Job Q&amp;A,
                    however, only users with paid memberships can post questions.</p>

                    <p>To access Q&amp;A for a specific job:</p>

                    <ol><li>Go to the “Hire” tab and select the job you want to access “Q&amp;A” for.</li><li>Click on “Job Post” tab.</li><li>Scroll down to access the Job Q&amp;A section.</li></ol>

                    <p>We encourage all Employers to use the
                    Q&amp;A feature to provide relevant information to Freelancers. However,</p>

                    <ol><li>Don’t make any derogatory or
                    sarcastic remarks.</li><li>Don’t share links that encourage
                    direct hiring.</li><li>Don’t share your contact information.</li></ol>

                    <p>Comments that don’t follow the guidelines
                    will be edited or removed. A notification is sent when your first comment is
                    removed. Failure to comply with guidelines three times would forfeit your
                    ability to post comments.</p>
