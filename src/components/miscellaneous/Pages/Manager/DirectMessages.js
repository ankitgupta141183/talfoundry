                    <p>Employers on Talfoundry have full control over
                    initiating communication with the Freelancers. Once a Freelancer sends a Quote,
                    Employers can send a direct message to them and discuss more about the Quote
                    and the job. Only Freelancers with paid memberships can send a message first
                    after sending a Quote (called Sales Messages). Employers also get the option to
                    end a discussion with a Freelancer anytime.</p>



                    <p>To send a direct message, click the “Message” button along with the Quote.</p>
