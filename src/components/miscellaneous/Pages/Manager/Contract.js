                    <p>An Agreement establishes the terms of
                    engagement between you and the Freelancer. It defines the scope of work and the
                    Payment terms. A binding Agreement in place helps to reduce chances of a
                    dispute.</p>



                    <p>Agreements can be edited at any time and
                    only come into effect once both parties agree. We recommend you start work only after
                    accepting the Agreement.</p>
