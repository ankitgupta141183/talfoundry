                    <p>Feedback is an overall rating (in percentage), that indicates the success of your working relationship with users on Talfoundry. A higher rating indicates that others have had an overall positive experience working with you on Talfoundry. </p>

                    <h2>Giving Feedback</h2>

                    <p>Giving feedback to Freelancers is important to let other Employers know about the experience you have had with the Freelancer on Talfoundry. Feedback is given in terms of your satisfaction of working with that Freelancer (satisfied/not satisfied).</p>

                    <p>As an Employer, you can give feedback only after you pay an invoice. You must give feedback within 60 days of making the payment, else feedback is set to “Satisfied” automatically.</p>

                    <p>Feedback is closely tied with the invoice and the invoice value. Here’s how it works:</p>

                    <ol><li>The value of the invoice determines the impact of a single feedback (satisfied&nbsp; or unsatisfied) on the overall Feedback Score.</li><li>The Feedback Score of a Freelancer is a weighted average of all feedback received by invoice value in the last 12 months and can be seen next to their name in Freelancer search results, Quotes and Freelancer profile.</li></ol>

                    <p></p>

                    <h2>Receiving Feedback</h2>

                    <p>An Employer’s Feedback Score indicates how well they have worked with Freelancers on Talfoundry. A high Feedback Score can attract Freelancers to apply to your jobs. Feedback is left by Freelancers you’ve worked with and can be given only once you successfully complete a transaction with them. Your Feedback Score can be seen by Freelancers next to your name in the job post and in the WorkRoom.</p>

                    <p>Your overall Feedback Score is a weighted average of all feedback received by spends in the last 12 months.</p>

                    <p>It is calculated using the following formula:</p>

                    <h4><em>Note: </em></h4>

                    <ul><li><em>All feedback is reviewed and documented by
                    our Support Team to ensure transparency and fairness. We do not post negative
                    comments publicly, but follow up with both parties if any action is required.</em></li></ul>
